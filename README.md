# CyberSport Website Project

A gaming-themed website built using **plain PHP**, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project was developed during my web development course to practice server-side rendering, form handling, and object-oriented PHP.

## 🚀 Overview

The CyberSport Website allows users to explore, manage, and post gaming-related content:

- **User Accounts & Authorization:** Users can register and log in. Passwords are securely handled using hashing to provide insight into how authentication works.  
- **Dashboard & Profile:** After login, users can access a dashboard and manage their profile.  
- **CRUD for Gaming Posts:** Users can create (write), update (edit), and delete (remove) blog posts in the gaming section.  
- **Contact Page:** A contact form enables users to send messages.  
- **Dynamic Content with PHP:** Business logic is implemented using plain PHP classes (`classes/`) and separated logic files (`logics/`).  
- **Interactive UI:** JavaScript is used for client-side interactivity and form handling.  
- **Clean & Responsive UI:** Styled with CSS for a structured and visually appealing layout.  

This project gave me hands-on experience with **full-stack PHP applications**, emphasizing backend logic, CRUD operations, and authentication processes.
